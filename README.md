I have some issues accessing the mushroom data using fetch_ucirepo API when I rerun the code, therefore I have to use the downloaded version.

- mushroom_taiyu.ipynb : the Jupyter notebook that I wrote
- agaricus-lepiota.data : The data I used
- agaricus-lepiota.name :some description about the data
